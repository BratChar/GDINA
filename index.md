# Goal of the GDINA R Package
The GDINA R package provides a framework for cognitive diagnostic analyses
for both dichotomous and polytomous responses within the generalized DINA model framework
(G-DINA; de la Torre, 2011) and its extensions (e.g., the sequential G-DINA model; Ma & de la Torre, 2016).

Various cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) can be calibrated using the GDINA
function, including the G-DINA model, the deterministic inputs,
noisy and gate (DINA; de la Torre, 2009; Junker & Sijtsma, 2001) model,
the deterministic inputs, noisy or gate (DINO; Templin & Henson, 2006)
model, the reduced reparametrized unified model (R-RUM; Hartz, 2002),
the additive CDM (A-CDM; de la Torre, 2011), and the linear logistic
model (LLM; Maris, 1999;).Note that the LLM is also called
compensatory RUM and the RRUM is equivalent to the generalized NIDA model.
For ordinal and nominal responses, the sequential G-DINA model (Ma, & de la Torre, 2016) is fitted and all
aforementioned CDMs can be used as the processing function at the category level.
Different CDMs can be assigned to different items within a single assessment.
Item parameters are estimated using the MMLE/EM algorithm. Details about the algorithm
can be found in de la Torre (2009), de la Torre (2011) and
Ma, Iaconangelo, & de la Torre (2016).
The higher-order attribute structure (de la Torre, & Douglas, 2004),
polytomous attributes (Chen, & de la Torre, 2013) and attribute
structures (e.g., linear, divergent)
can also be accommodated. Monotonicity constraints for item/category success
probabilities can also be specified.

Q-matrix validation (de la Torre, & Chiu, 2016),
item and model fit statistics (Chen, de la Torre, & Zhang, 2013),
model comparison at the test and item level (de la Torre, & Lee, 2013;
Ma, Iaconangelo, & de la Torre, 2016),
and differential item functioning (Hou, de la Torre, & Nandakumar, 2014) can also be conducted.
