Details about the algorithm\r\ncan be found in de la Torre (2009), de la Torre (2011) and\r\nMa, Iaconangelo, & de la Torre (2016).\r\nThe higher-order attribute structure (de la Torre, & Douglas, 2004),\r\npolytomous attributes (Chen, & de la Torre, 2013) and attribute\r\nstructures (e.g., linear, divergent)\r\ncan also be accommodated. Monotonicity constraints for item/category success\r\nprobabilities can also be specified.\r\n\r\nQ-matrix validation (de la Torre, & Chiu, 2016),\r\nitem and model fit statistics (Chen, de la Torre, & Zhang, 2013),\r\nmodel comparison at the test and item level (de la Torre, & Lee, 2013;\r\nMa, Iaconangelo, & de la Torre, 2016),\r\nand differential item functioning (Hou, de la Torre, & Nandakumar, 2014) can also be conducted.\r\n\r\n# Recent Workshops\r\n* Workshop in the Fourth Conference on the Statistical Methods in Psychometrics from August 30 to September 1, 2016 at Columbia University [Announcement](https://sites.google.com/site/2016psychometrics/)\r\n* Workshop from November 30 to December 1, 2016 at Brazil \r\n\r\n\r\n",
